sales_integration.py

This cog adds commands for simple sales confirmation and logging. It
introduces a `/confirm_sale` slash command that sellers can use to
record a completed transaction with a buyer. Transactions are stored
in the `transactions` table via utils.db.log_transaction. Future
enhancements could include escrow management and multi-item threads.
