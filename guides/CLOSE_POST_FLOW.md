### 2. **Post Creator WITH Reviews**
- ✅ Can close their own post immediately
- ✅ No confirmation required  
- ✅ Must have at least 1 review

### 3. **Post Creator WITHOUT Reviews** ⭐ **NEW**
- ⚠️ Shows confirmation modal before closing
- 📋 Modal Title: "Close Post Confirmation"
- 📝 Required Input: Type "Yes" to confirm
- ❌ Cancellation: Any other input cancels closure

## Benefits

- Clear acknowledgment that no reviews were received
- Easy to cancel if clicked by mistake

### **Flexibility**
- Still allows closure when truly needed
- No permanent blocking of post closure
- Maintains user control over their posts

### **Admin Override**

- No extra steps for administrative actions
- Clear distinction between user and admin closures

## Implementation Notes

The confirmation modal is implemented in the `CloseConfirmationModal` class and integrates seamlessly with the existing logging and thread management systems.

### Code Flow
```python
1. User clicks "Close Post"
2. Check: Is user admin? → Skip to immediate close
3. Check: Is user post creator? → Continue
4. Check: Does post have reviews? 
   - YES → Close immediately
   - NO → Show confirmation modal
5. Modal: User types "Yes" → Close with special message
```

This provides the perfect balance of user protection and flexibility!
